# Options

This directory provides structured documentation for all configuration options used by Waybar.

- Each option is documented in an individual file named after the option itself (for example, the `height` option is documented in `height.md`).
- All option files adhere to the standardized format defined in `00_options_notes_format.md`.
- Files located directly in this directory describe global, bar-level configuration options that are not associated with any specific module.
- Module-scoped options are documented within subdirectories named after their respective modules (for example, options for the `battery` module are located in the `battery` directory).
